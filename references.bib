	title = {The economics of artificial intelligence: {Implications} for the future of work},
	abstract = {The current wave of technological change based on advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has created widespread fear of job losses and further rises in inequality. This paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of AI and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a wide-spread adoption of AI. It argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low-skilled. At the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from AI-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. For this, skills policy are necessary but not sufficient. In addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy and help share the benefits of productivity growth through a combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation and a reduction in working time. The paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from artificial intelligence, provided policy-makers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account.},

Therefore, urban policy must promote the jobs and skills that increase worker pay, create employment, and foster economic resilience. In this paper, we model labor market resilience with an ecologically-inspired job network constructed from the similarity of occupations’ skill requirements. This framework reveals that the economic resilience of cities is universally and uniquely determined by the connectivity within a city’s job network. US cities with greater job connectivity experienced lower unemployment during the Great Recession. Further, cities that increase their job connectivity see increasing wage bills, and workers of embedded occupations enjoy higher wages than their peers elsewhere. Finally, we show how job connectivity may clarify the augmenting and deleterious impact of automation in US cities. Policies that promote labor connectivity may grow labor markets and promote economic resilience.},

	abstract = {Economic inequality is one of the biggest challenges facing society today. Inequality has been recently exacerbated by growth in high- and low-wage occupations at the expense of middle-wage occupations, leading to a “hollowing” of the middle class. Yet, our understanding of how workplace skills drive this process is limited. Specifically, how do skill requirements distinguish high- and low-wage occupations, and does this distinction constrain the mobility of individuals and urban labor markets? Using unsupervised clustering techniques from network science, we show that skills exhibit a striking polarization into two clusters that highlight the specific social-cognitive skills and sensory-physical skills of high- and low-wage occupations, respectively. The connections between skills explain various dynamics: how workers transition between occupations, how cities acquire comparative advantage in new skills, and how individual occupations change their skill requirements. We also show that the polarized skill topology constrains the career mobility of individual workers, with low-skill workers “stuck” relying on the low-wage skill set. Together, these results provide a new explanation for the persistence of occupational polarization and inform strategies to mitigate the negative effects of automation and offshoring of employment. In addition to our analysis, we provide an online tool for the public and policy makers to explore the skill network: skillscape.mit.edu.},

We further examine skill requirements across and within four major professional occupations in the U.S. energy sector and find substantial variations. Meanwhile, in the energy sector, although cognitive and social skills are the most frequently required skills, they do not positively contribute to firm productivity. Although the requirement for “hard” skills (such as products and marketing, engineering, and general computer skill) stays relatively flat, “hard” skills actually matter most in the energy sector, especially products and marketing and general computer skills are two most valuable skills, contributing the highest to energy firms. Our results indicate that energy firms should pay more attention to “hard” skills in human resource management, while not following the increasing trend of “soft” skills in hiring.},

Machines complement human labor when they become more productive at the jobs they perform, but machines also substitute for human labor by taking over human jobs. At ﬁrst, expensive hardware and software does only the few jobs where computers have the strongest advantage over humans. Eventually, computers do most jobs. At ﬁrst, complementary eﬀects dominate, and human wages rise with computer productivity. But eventually substitution can dominate, making wages fall as fast as computer prices now do. An intelligence population explosion makes per-intelligence consumption fall this fast, while economic growth rates rise by an order of magnitude or more.

We label this process of determining the payoffs ‘judgment.’ There is a risky action, whose payoff depends on the state, and a safe action with the same payoff in every state. Judgment is costly; for each potential state, it requires thought on what the payoff might be. Prediction and judgment are complements as long as judgment is not too difficult. We show that in complex environments with a large number of potential states, the effect of improvements in prediction on the importance of judgment depend a great deal on whether the improvements in prediction enable automated decision-making. We discuss the implications of improved prediction in the face of complexity for automation, contracts, and firm boundaries.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a revival of concerns that automation and digitalisation might after all result in a jobless future. The debate has been fuelled by studies for the US and Europe arguing that a substantial share of jobs is at “risk of computerisation”. These studies follow an occupation-based approach proposed by Frey and Osborne (2013), i.e. they assume that whole occupations rather than single job-tasks are automated by technology. As we argue, this might lead to an overestimation of job automatibility, as occupations labelled as high-risk occupations often still contain a substantial share of tasks that are hard to automate. Our paper serves two purposes. Firstly, we estimate the job automatibility of jobs for 21 OECD countries based on a task-based approach. In contrast to other studies, we take into account the heterogeneity of workers’ tasks within occupations. Overall, we find that, on average across the 21 OECD countries, 9 \% of jobs are automatable. The threat from technological advances thus seems much less pronounced compared to the occupation-based approach. We further find heterogeneities across OECD countries. For instance, while the share of automatable jobs is 6 \% in Korea, the corresponding share is 12 \% in Austria. Differences between countries may reflect general differences in workplace organisation, differences in previous investments into automation technologies as well as differences in the education of workers across countries.},

Labour markets whose initial industry composition exposes them to rising Chinese import competition experience significant falls in employment, particularly in manufacturing and among non-college workers. Labour markets susceptible to computerisation due to specialisation in routine task-intensive activities instead experience occupational polarisation within manufacturing and non-manufacturing but do not experience a net employment decline. Trade impacts rise in the 2000s as imports accelerate, while the effect of technology appears to shift from automation of production activities in manufacturing towards computerisation of information-processing tasks in non-manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human–machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.},

Instead, modeling it as the process of machines replacing tasks previously performed by labor is both descriptively realistic and leads to distinct and plausible predictions. In contrast to factor-augmenting technological change, the automation of tasks always reduces the labor share and can reduce the equilibrium wage (for realistic parameter values). This approach to automation underscores the role of new tasks, changes in the comparative advantage of labor, the possibility that machines become more productive in automated tasks, and the elasticity of substitution and capital accumulation in the adjustment of the economy.},

	abstract = {A central organizing framework of the voluminous recent literature studying changes in the returns to skills and the evolution of earnings inequality is what we refer to as the canonical model, which elegantly and powerfully operationalizes the supply and demand for skills by assuming two distinct skill groups that perform two different and imperfectly substitutable tasks or produce two imperfectly substitutable goods. Technology is assumed to take a factor-augmenting form, which, by complementing either high or low skill workers, can generate skill biased demand shifts. In this paper, we argue that despite its notable successes, the canonical model is largely silent on a number of central empirical developments of the last three decades, including: (1) significant declines in real wages of low skill workers, particularly low skill males; (2) non-monotone changes in wages at different parts of the earnings distribution during different decades; (3) broad-based increases in employment in high skill and low skill occupations relative to middle skilled occupations (i.e., job “polarization’’); (4) rapid diffusion of new technologies that directly substitute capital for labor in tasks previously performed by moderately skilled workers; and (5) expanding offshoring in opportunities, enabled by technology, which allow foreign labor to substitute for domestic workers specific tasks. Motivated by these patterns, we argue that it is valuable to consider a richer framework for analyzing how recent changes in the earnings and employment distribution in the United States and other advanced economies are shaped by the interactions among worker skills, job tasks, evolving technologies, and shifting trading opportunities. We propose a tractable task-based model in which the assignment of skills to tasks is endogenous and technical change may involve the substitution of machines for certain tasks previously performed by labor. We further consider how the evolution of technology in this task-based setting may be endogenized. We show how such a framework can be used to interpret several central recent trends, and we also suggest further directions for empirical exploration.},

	abstract = {Many technological innovations replace workers with machines, but this capital-labor substitution need not reduce aggregate labor demand because it simultaneously induces four countervailing responses: own-industry output effects; cross-industry input–output effects; between-industry shifts; and final demand effects. We quantify these channels using four decades of harmonized cross-country and industry data, where we measure automation as industry-level movements in total factor productivity (TFP) that are common across countries. We find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor's share of value-added in the industries in which it originates (a direct effect). In the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand. By contrast, own-industry labor share losses are not recouped elsewhere. Our framework can account for a substantial fraction of the reallocation of employment across industries and the aggregate fall in the labor share over the last three decades. It does not, however, explain why the labor share fell more rapidly during the 2000s},

These include: damaging competition, consumer privacy and consumer choice; excessively automating work, fueling inequality, inefficiently pushing down wages, and failing to improve worker productivity; and damaging political discourse, democracy's most fundamental lifeblood. Although there is no conclusive evidence suggesting that these costs are imminent or substantial, it may be useful to understand them before they are fully realized and become harder or even impossible to reverse, precisely because of AI's promising and wide-reaching potential. I also suggest that these costs are not inherent to the nature of AI technologies, but are related to how they are being used and developed at the moment - to empower corporations and governments against workers and citizens. As a result, efforts to limit and reverse these costs may need to rely on regulation and policies to redirect AI research. Attempts to contain them just by promoting competition may be insufficient.},

	abstract = {We examine the concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant in a framework in which tasks previously performed by labor can be automated and new versions of existing tasks, in which labor has a comparative advantage, can be created. In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automation and the introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality stabilizes in the long run.

At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor-the task content of production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production-due to automation and new tasks-can be inferred from industrylevel data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.},

We also document more automation innovation in countries undergoing faster aging. Our directed technological change model predicts that the response of automation technologies to aging should be more pronounced in industries that rely more on middle-aged workers and those that present greater opportunities for automation and that productivity should improve and the labor share should decline relatively in industries that are more amenable to automation.

We develop a conceptual framework where tasks across industries are allocated to different types of labor and capital. Automation technologies expand the set of tasks performed by capital, displacing certain worker groups from jobs for which they have comparative advantage. This framework yields a simple equation linking wage changes of a demographic group to the task displacement it experiences. We report robust evidence in favor of this relationship and show that regression models incorporating task displacement explain much of the changes in education wage differentials between 1980 and 2016. The negative relationship between wage changes and task displacement is unaffected when we control for changes in market power, deunionization, and other forms of capital deepening and technology unrelated to automation. We also propose a methodology for evaluating the full general equilibrium effects of automation, which incorporate induced changes in industry composition and ripple effects due to task reallocation across different groups. Our quantitative evaluation explains how major changes in wage inequality can go hand-in-hand with modest productivity gains.},

	abstract = {To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to "buy" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.},

Automation is related to more stable employment within firms for incumbents, and this is driven by workers taking over new tasks in their original plants. Several measures indicate that those new jobs are of higher quality than the previous ones. Young workers also adapt their educational choices, and substitute away from vocational training towards colleges and universities.

            The stability of the labor share of income is a key foundation in macroeconomic models. We document, however, that the global labor share has significantly declined since the early 1980s, with the decline occurring within the large majority of countries and industries. We show that the decrease in the relative price of investment goods, often attributed to advances in information technology and the computer age, induced firms to shift away from labor and toward capital. The lower price of investment goods explains roughly half of the observed decline in the labor share, even when we allow for other mechanisms influencing factor shares, such as increasing profits, capital-augmenting technology growth, and the changing skill composition of the labor force. We highlight the implications of this explanation for welfare and macroeconomic dynamics.},

	abstract = {Technology is widely considered the main source of economic progress, but it has also generated cultural anxiety throughout history. The developed world is now suffering from another bout of such angst. Anxieties over technology can take on several forms, and we focus on three of the most prominent concerns. First, there is the concern that technological progress will cause widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment and a further increase in inequality in the short run, even if the long-run effects are beneficial. Second, there has been anxiety over the moral implications of technological process for human welfare, broadly defined. While, during the Industrial Revolution, the worry was about the dehumanizing effects of work, in modern times, perhaps the greater fear is a world where the elimination of work itself is the source of dehumanization. A third concern cuts in the opposite direction, suggesting that the epoch of major technological progress is behind us. Understanding the history of technological anxiety provides perspective on whether this time is truly different. We consider the role of these three anxieties among economists, primarily focusing on the historical period from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and then compare the historical and current manifestations of these three concerns.},

The first is that such technological innovations are not everywhere adopted, but only in countries with high productivity. The second result is that technology adoption significantly amplifies differences in productivity between countries. This paper can, therefore, add to our understanding of large and persistent international differences in output per capita. The model also helps to explain other growth phenomena, like divergence or periods of rapid growth.},

	abstract = {We apply an understanding of what computers do to study how computerization alters job skill demands. We argue that computer capital (1) substitutes for workers in performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules; and (2) complements workers in performing nonroutine problem-solving and complex communications tasks. Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We find that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is associated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact.},

AI, as a technology platform, can automate tasks previously performed by labor or create new tasks and activities in which humans can be productively employed.

The consequences of this choice have been stagnating labor demand, declining labor share in national income, rising inequality and lower productivity growth.

Dabei wird deutlich, dass die fortschreitende Digitalisierung weitreichende Auswirkungen auf die zukünftige Arbeitswelt haben wird. Um abschätzen zu können, wie sich die Arbeitswelt zukünftig weiter entwickeln wird, müssen wir aber zunächst einmal klären, wo Deutschland heute steht. Wie stark sind Berufe schon heute potenziell ersetzbar, weil Tätigkeiten, die derzeit noch von Beschäftigten erledigt werden, demnächst von Computern übernommen werden? In diesem Forschungsbericht ermitteln wir deshalb für die einzelnen Berufe den Anteil der Tätigkeiten, der schon heutzutage durch Computer ersetzt werden könnte. Wir berechnen diese Substituierbarkeitspotenziale der Berufe auf Grundlage von Berufsdaten aus der Expertendatenbank BERUFENET der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. Damit können wir die Spezifika des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes und Bildungssystems unmittelbar berücksichtigen. Im Ergebnis sind 15 Prozent der sozialversicherungspflichtig Beschäftigten in Deutschland im Jahr 2013 einem sehr hohen Substituierbarkeitspotenzial ausgesetzt, also in einem Beruf beschäftigt, bei dem mehr als 70 Prozent der Tätigkeiten heute schon durch Computer ersetzt werden könnten. Wir stellen unsere Ergebnisse detailliert nach dem Anforderungsniveau, für die Berufssegmente sowie für die Berufssegmente getrennt für die unterschiedlichen Anforderungsniveaus nach der Klassifikation der Berufe 2010 dar. Im Anhang präsentieren wir zudem Ergebnisse für die Berufshauptgruppen getrennt für die unterschiedlichen Anforderungsniveaus nach der Klassifikation der Berufe 2010 sowie für die BIBB-Berufsfelder.},

Nevertheless, computerization will, to some extent, affect all occupations. There can be considerable difficulties for economies to adjust in the shorter run simply because there may be an overwhelming amount of job destruction and an insufficient amount of job creation. The digital transformation of society itself, however, creates a significant number of new needs, and a good way to respond to these needs is to place major emphasis on giving the workforce appropriate and adaptable competences.},

Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.

	abstract = {This article analyzes how patent-induced shocks to labor productivity propagate into worker compensation using a new linkage of U.S. patent applications to U.S. business and worker tax records. We infer the causal effects of patent allowances by comparing firms whose patent applications were initially allowed to those whose patent applications were initially rejected. To identify patents that are ex ante valuable, we extrapolate the excess stock return estimates of Kogan et al. (2017) to the full set of accepted and rejected patent applications based on predetermined firm and patent application characteristics. An initial allowance of an ex ante valuable patent generates substantial increases in firm productivity and worker compensation. By contrast, initial allowances of lower ex ante value patents yield no detectable effects on firm outcomes. Patent allowances lead firms to increase employment, but entry wages and workforce composition are insensitive to patent decisions. On average, workers capture roughly 30 cents of every dollar of patent-induced surplus in higher earnings. This share is roughly twice as high among workers present since the year of application. These earnings effects are concentrated among men and workers in the top half of the earnings distribution and are paired with corresponding improvements in worker retention among these groups. We interpret these earnings responses as reflecting the capture of economic rents by senior workers, who are most costly for innovative firms to replace.},

First, the task approach from labor economics is reformulated and integrated into a growth model. Second, the standard representative household assumption is rejected, so that aggregate demand restrictions can be introduced. With these novel features it is shown that (i) AI automation can decrease the share of labor income no matter the size of the elasticity of substitution between AI and labor, and (ii) when this elasticity is high, AI will unambiguously reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth, even in the face of the positive technology shock that AI entails. If the elasticity of substitution is low, then GDP, productivity and wage growth may however still slow down, because the economy will then fail to benefit from the supply-side driven capacity expansion potential that AI can deliver. The model can thus explain why advanced countries tend to experience, despite much AI hype, the simultaneous existence of rather high employment with stagnating wages, productivity, and GDP.},

This paper aims to explore its potential impact on hospitality industry employees, bringing enlightenment to both employees and managers. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a survey of 432 employees who worked in full-service hotels in China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. Findings Results presented a positive relationship between AI awareness and job burnout. No significant direct relationship was found between AI awareness and career competencies. Organizational commitment mediated the relationship between AI awareness and career competencies, as well as the relationship between AI awareness and job burnout. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to human resource management in the hospitality industry to theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretically, it enriched both career theory and fit theory. Practically, this study reminds managers to pay attention to the adverse effect of AI on human capital. It also enlightens the manager to think of the positive effects that AI may bring. Managers should provide proper support to overcome AI’s threat to human resources.

The immediate concern is whether labor can win a 'race against the robots' and the longer-term concern is whether an artificial general intelligence (super-intelligence) can be controlled. This paper describes the nature and context of these concerns, reviews the current state of the empirical and theoretical literature in economics on the impact of AI on jobs and inequality, and discusses the challenge of AI arms races. It is concluded that despite the media hype neither massive jobs losses nor a 'Singularity' are imminent.In part, this is because current AI, based on deep learning, is expensive and difficult for (especially small) businesses to adopt, can create new jobs, and is an unlikely route to the invention of a super-intelligence. Even though AI is unlikely to have either utopian or apocalyptic impacts, it will challenge economists in coming years. The challenges include regulation of data and algorithms; the (mis-) measurement of value added; market failures, anti-competitive behaviour and abuse of market power; surveillance, censorship, cybercrime; labor market discrimination, declining job quality; and AI in emerging economies.},

The ICT-based economy has several novel aspects that the industrial economy did not possess: network externalities, monopolies of platforms, provision of zero price services, and ambiguous roles between consumers and producers; ICT’s matching ability will cultivate markets in a deeper and more thorough manner than before. While the demand for high-skill labor related to technological progress increases, the skills gap remains wide. How will individuals who are under permanent threat of unemployment or are excluded from the market by AI respond to this situation? In this chapter, I propose a simple thought experiment to consider the impact of AI on the labor market. In this experiment, I examine the following aspects: the social implementation of AI, responses of workers to survive, social cost of unemployment, possibility of disruption, and the advent of a new society accompanied by changes in values. These analyses will help determine how institutional design and economic policy can be harnessed to address the social dilemma arising from technological innovations that raise labor productivity.},

Yet, traditional economic optimism about the beneficent effects of technology for productivity and welfare has eroded as understanding has advanced.

	abstract = {The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our contemporary society imposes historically unique challenges for humankind. The emerging autonomy of AI holds unique potentials of eternal life of robots, AI and algorithms alongside unprecedented economic superiority, data storage and computational advantages. Yet to this day, it remains unclear what impact AI taking over the workforce will have on economic growth. This paper therefore first establishes what AI is and provides a theoretical background on standard neoclassical and heterodox economics growth theories with particular attention to the Cambridge Capital Controversy’s argument to divide capital components into fluid, hence more flexible (e.g., petty cash, checking account), and more clay, hence more inflexible (e.g., factories and intransferable means of production), components. The contemporary trend of slowbalisation is described, as the slowing down of conventional globalization of goods, services and Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flows; yet at the same time, we still see human migration and air travel as well as data transfer continuing to rise. These market trends of conventional globalization slowing and rising AI-related industries are proposed as first market disruption in the wake of the large-scale entrance of AI into our contemporary economy. Growth in the artificial age is then proposed to be measured based on two AI entrance proxies of Global Connectivity Index and The State of the Mobile Internet Connectivity 2018 Index, which is found to be highly significantly positively correlated with the total inflow of migrants and FDI inflow – serving as evidence that the still globalizing rising industries in the age of slowbalisation are connected to AI. Both indices are positively correlated with GDP output in cross-sectional studies over the world. In order to clarify if the found effect is a sign of industrialization, time series of worldwide data reveal that internet connectivity around the world is associated with lower economic growth from around 2000 on until 2017. A regression plotting Internet Connectivity and GDP per capita as independent variables to explain the dependent variable GDP growth outlines that the effect for AI is a significant determinant of negative GDP growth prospects for the years from 2000 until 2017. A panel regression plotting GDP per capita and internet connectivity from the year 2000 to explain economic growth consolidates the finding that AI-internet connectivity is a significant determinant of negative growth over time for 161 countries of the world. Internet connectivity is associated with economic growth decline whereas GDP per capita has no significant relation with GDP growth. To cross-validate both findings hold for two different global connectivity measurements. The paper then discusses a theoretical argument of dividing labor components into fluid, hence more flexible (e.g., AI), and more clay, hence more inflexible (e.g., human labor), components. The paper ends on a call for revising growth theories and integrating AI components into growth theory. AI entrance into economic markets is modeled into the standard neoclassical growth theory by creating a novel index for representing growth in the artificial age comprised of GDP per capita and AI entrance measured by the proxy of Internet Access percent per country. Maps reveal the parts of the world that feature high GDP per capita and AI-connectivity. The discussion closes with a future outlook on the law and economics of AI entrance into our contemporary economies and society in order to aid a successful and humane introduction of AI into our world.},

	abstract = {This article outlines relevant economic patterns in a world with artificial intelligence (AI). Five specific economic patterns influenced by AI are discussed: (1) following in the footsteps of ‘homo economicus’ a new type of agent, ‘machina economica’, enters the stage of the global economy. (2) The pattern of division of labor and specialization is further accelerated by AI-induced micro-division of labor. (3) The introduction of AI leads to triangular agency relationships and next level information asymmetries. (4) Data and AI-based machine labor have to be understood as new factors of production. (5) The economics of AI networks can lead to market dominance and unwanted external effects. The analytical perspective is rooted in institutional economics and serves to integrate findings from relevant disciplines in economics and computer science. It is based on the research proposition that ‘institutional matters’ are of high relevance also in a world with AI but that AI gives a new meaning to these matters. The discussion unveils a reinforcing interdependence of the patterns portrayed and points to required research.},

The importance of Artificial Intelligence for companies is also a mayor subject that may cause conflicts among cities around the world. Seasonal workers, 24 hours contracts, and informal methods of employments are reducing the possibilities of collective agreements and job satisfaction. Consequently, the so-called “Information Society”, labor modifications and role transformations have played a key role and have had an ascending evolution. There are different jobs that have been relegated to a substantial change in different industries due to all the information technology advances and robotics innovations. This process will increase in upcoming decades by establishing new types of jobs to sustain this changing economy. The controversy starts when this “macro” and “micro” vision collide with those people who have been dismissed due to the automation process. Because of the facts mentioned and current market trends, we can confirm that digital changes and transformations will continue to increase.},

machine imitate a human so well that its answers to questions were indistinguishable from
a human's? Ever since, creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has
implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers, and
entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring
productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our
own minds. But not all types of AI are human-like-in fact, many of the most powerful
systems are very different from humans-and an excessive focus on developing and deploying
HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human labor,
workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on
those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans
rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value
created. What is more, augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and
services, ultimately generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types
of AI can be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation
rather than augmentation among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence is designed to generate technologies that potentially increase productivity and economic welfare. This study analyzes the relationship between GDP and high-technology exports, GDP per person employed, and unemployment rate in China, India, Japan, and Singapore. Recent concerns on technological unemployment claim that artificial intelligence disrupts the labor market which decreases employment over time. Using the multiple regression analysis, this study proved that Japan comparatively has better utilization of AI and labor productivity as all independent variables show significance to the GDP. Labor productivity in all countries is positively related to GDP. However, China and India showed signs of improper AI utilization as technological unemployment occurred. The unemployment rate in China is insignificant to its GDP, while India's unemployment rate is positively related to GDP, hence the jobless growth. In Singapore, the insignificance of high-tech exports to GDP is due to its lack of R\&amp;D investments these recent years. The results suggest that AI escalates growth through proper utilization trade liberalization, as exercised by Japan, as it helps the economy to be open and flexible to various free trade agreements which facilitates technological progress and enables the opening of new markets for growth and expansion, especially of artificial intelligence, which attracts and encourage foreign direct investments that will cater technology transfer, creation of new jobs, and economic growth.},

	abstract = {Research background: This article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) is affecting workers' personal and professional lives, because of many technological disruptions driven by the recent pandemic that are redefining global labor markets.
Purpose of the article: The objective of this paper is to develop a systematic review of the relevant literature to identify the effects of technological change, especially the adoption of AI in organizations, on employees’ skills (professional dimension) and well-being (personal dimension).
Methods: To implement the research scope, the authors relied on Khan's five-step methodology, which included a PRISMA flowchart with embedded keywords for selecting the appropriate quantitative data for the study. Firstly, 639 scientific papers published between March 2020 to March 2023 (the end of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the WHO) from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases were selected. After applying the relevant procedures and techniques, 103 articles were retained, which focused on the professional dimension, while 35 papers were focused on the personal component.
Findings \&amp; value added: Evidence has been presented highlighting the difficulties associated with the ongoing requirement for upskilling or reskilling as an adaptive reaction to technological changes. The efforts to counterbalance the skill mismatch impacted employees' well-being in the challenging pandemic times. Although the emphasis on digital skills is widely accepted, our investigation shows that the topic is still not properly developed. The paper's most significant contributions are found in a thorough analysis of how AI affects workers' skills and well-being, highlighting the most representative aspects researched by academic literature due to the recent paradigm changes generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and continuous technological disruptions.},

We investigate the link between AI and labor by creating a new measure that we call the AI Occupational Impact (AIOI). The AIOI measure links advances in specific applications of AI, such as image recognition, translation, or the ability to play strategic games, to workplace abilities and occupations. We use this measure to study the relationship between AI and wages, employment, and labor market polarization. We provide evidence that, on average, occupations impacted by AI experience a small but positive change in wages, but no change in employment. We also provide evidence that the positive correlation with wages is driven primarily by occupations with higher software skill requirements, and that higher-income occupations have a strong positive relationship between our measure of AI impact and both employment and wages. These findings suggest that access to complementary skills and technologies may play an important role in determining the impact of AI, and that AI has the potential to exacerbate labor market polarization.},

	abstract = {While labor-displacing AI has the potential to transform critical aspects of society in the near future, previous work has ignored the possibility of the extreme labor displacement scenarios that could result. To explore this we surveyed attendees of three AI conferences in 2018 about near-to-mid-term AI labor displacement as well as five more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Practitioners indicated that a median of 22\% of tasks which humans are currently paid to do could be automated with existing AI; they anticipate this figure rising to 40\% in 5 years and 60\% in 10 years. Median forecasts indicated a 50\% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90\% of human tasks in 25 years and 99\% of human tasks in 50 years. Practitioners surveyed at the different conferences had similar forecasts for AI labor displacement this decade, but attendees of the Human-level AI Conference had significantly shorter and more precise forecasts for the more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Interestingly, median forecasts of a 10\% probability of 90\% and 99\% of human tasks being automated were 10 years and 15 years, respectively. We conclude that future of work researchers should more carefully consider these relatively high likelihoods of extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios.},

As AI-driven technologies are increasingly integrated into workplaces and labor processes, many have expressed worry about the widespread displacement of human workers. The chapter presents a more nuanced view of the common rhetoric that robots will take over people’s jobs. We contend that economic forecasts of massive AI-induced job loss are of limited practical utility, as they tend to focus solely on technical aspects of task execution, while neglecting broader contextual inquiry about the social components of work, organi­zational structures, and cross-industry effects. The chapter then considers how AI might impact workers through modes other than displacement. We highlight four mechanisms through which firms are beginning to use AI-driven tools to reallocate risks from them­selves to workers: algorithmic scheduling, task redefinition, loss and fraud prediction, and incentivization of productivity. We then explore potential policy responses to both dis­placement and risk-shifting concerns.},

Second, will AI technology have an impact on the economy different from that of previous new technologies? Third, in which aspects will AI have an impact, and what is the empirical evidence for these effects of AI? On the first question, our review reveals that the incorporation of AI into economic models raises fundamental questions on economics and economic models. On the second question, while most empirical studies cannot deny the existence of the Solow Paradox for AI technology, some studies find that AI would have a different and broader impact than previous technologies. On the third question, studies on the labor market seem to suggest a stylized fact regarding the impact of AI on employment on different levels, and income inequality across skill levels and between developing and developed countries. The impacts of AI on international trade and education have been largely neglected and are worth further research in the future. It is also important for both theoretical and empirical studies to have a clear and accurate definition of AI so that the results are not misinterpreted.},

This chapter aims at providing an updated picture of the main empirical evidence on the relationship between new technologies and employment both in terms of overall consequences on the number of employees, tasks required, and wage/inequality effect.},

It can also help in developing realistic scenarios about how jobs and skill demand will be redefined in the next decades and how education systems should evolve in response. This chapter provides a literature review of studies that aim at measuring the extent to which AI and robotics can automate work. The chapter presents five assessment approaches: 1) an approach that focuses on occupational tasks and analyzes whether these tasks can be automated; 2) an approach that draws on information from patents to assess computer capabilities; 3) indicators that use AI-related job postings as a proxy for AI deployment in firms; 4) measures relying on benchmarks from computer science; 5) and an approach that compares computer capabilities to human skills using standardized tests developed for humans. The chapter discusses the differences between these measurement approaches and assesses their strengths and weaknesses. It concludes by formulating recommendations for future work.},

	abstract = {Our study analyzes the advantages that automation presents for the job. The main new feature of our framework is that, in addition to the part of jobs that are displaced by automation, it also leads to the creation of new, more complex versions of existing tasks, which leads to the demand for employment. We focused more on the essential factor which is the degree of skill to take advantage of these new jobs. We carry out research based on information relating to automation and jobs. Also, by using the output of the final good model, we show that the creation of new tasks in which the labor has a comparative advantage is one of the positive aspects of automation. We find that automation will create new jobs (smart jobs) and eliminates repetitive jobs which will be replaced by machines in the future. However, these new jobs will need high skills. Therefore, the level and quality of education will play important role in the new jobs that automation will generate. Workers and future students must prepare themselves by focusing their training more on the skills that new technologies will require. Automation may prepare us for a future in which workers with low skills will be forced to change occupations or lose their occupations, which will be completely occupied by machines. We find also that the job loss depends on the speed of automation in each country. Based on the economic structure, the investment policy in new technology, and the level of education of countries, the speed at which automation spread is slower in some countries and intense in others. Therefore, the job is more at risk in countries with high automation than in those with medium or low automation.},

	abstract = {Introduction The future of work is characterized by changes that could disrupt all aspects of the nature and availability of work. Our study aims to understand how the future of work could result in conditions, which contribute to vulnerability for different groups of workers. Methods A horizon scan was conducted to systematically identify and synthesize diverse sources of evidence, including academic and gray literature and resources shared over social media. Evidence was synthesized, and trend categories were developed through iterative discussions among the research team. Results Nine trend categories were uncovered, which included the digital transformation of the economy, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning-enhanced automation, AI-enabled human resource management systems, skill requirements for the future of work; globalization 4.0, climate change and the green economy, Gen Zs and the work environment; populism and the future of work, and external shocks to accelerate the changing nature of work. The scan highlighted that some groups of workers may be more likely to experience conditions that contribute to vulnerability, including greater exposure to job displacement or wage depression. The future of work could also create opportunities for labor market engagement. Conclusion The future of work represents an emerging public health concern. Exclusion from the future of work has the potential to widen existing social and health inequities. Thus, tailored supports that are resilient to changes in the nature and availability of work are required for workers facing vulnerability.},

Analysis of what actually happens in organisations introducing AI-enabled technologies is lacking. This Research Note proposes a third methodology based on the use of bespoke employer surveys. Drawing on a new and unique survey of UK business leaders, it illustrates the utility of this approach through the presentation of descriptive findings on the association between introduction of AI and job creation and destruction within organisations.

Employing a robust difference-in-differences method with propensity score matching, we investigate the heterogeneous impact of AI adoption upon different skills across three dimensions — geographical regions, enterprise types, and the length of time since the adoption of AI. We ﬁnd that AI reduces the relative demand for low-skilled labor across all regions in China, while increasing the relative demand for high-skilled labor only in the eastern region. These differential impacts of AI upon relative demand for different skills reﬂect ﬁrm-level technological intensity. Results also show that the longer the duration of AI use, the greater is the impact upon the relative demand for high-skilled labor.},

	abstract = {The focus of this book is to develop a plausible basis for reasoning in situations involving incomplete-partial information and developing principles and procedures for learning or recovering information from a sample of economic data. The book starts with the specification and analysis of the simplest parametric and semiparametric probability models. The following chapters then generalize the specification and the reasoning process. The authors' objective is to cover a sufficient scope of concepts and procedures to give the reader an adequate conceptual foundation from which to choose, learn about, and implement methods of analysis that avoid assumptions one does not wish to make in the formulation, estimation, and inference of probability models consistent with economic sampling processes.{\textbackslash}par The book is organized into ten parts. Part I discusses a general approach to searching for econometric knowledge and introduces an array of fundamental probability-econometric models that are used in practice to characterize economic data sampling processes. Part II is concerned with estimation and inference procedures for parametric and semiparametric variants of the linear regression models. The concept of extremum estimators is introduced in Part III; additionally, nonlinear-in-the-parameters regression models and nonnormal errors are considered. Part IV is concerned with stochastic right-hand-side variables, moment based specifications of the data sampling processes, empirical likelihood, and information theoretic procedures whose solutions cannot be written in closed form. In Part V, the restrictive i.i.d. noise component structure of the probability model is relaxed, and estimation and inference procedures for handling this more general error covariance model are developed.{\textbackslash}par In Part VI instrumental variables, the general method of moments for overdetermined problems, and the simultaneous equations probability model are examined. Model selection problems are considered in Part VII. Information recovery in discrete choice and nonparametric models is discussed in Part VIII. Part IX deals with basic concepts of Bayesian inference and their applications to regression models in the face of different posterior distributions. Part X ends the book with an assessment of the econometric developments in this book as well as with an assessment of possible econometric challenges.{\textbackslash}par The book contains a CD with various statistical programs, written in GAUSS, which can be used to replicate the procedures developed in this book},

Data from several sources are examined: the royalties from U.S. university patent portfolios, the quasi-rents from marketed pharmaceutical entities, the stock market returns from three large samples of high-technology venture startups, and preliminary results from a survey of German patents on which renewal fees were paid until full-term expiration in 1995.

	abstract = {Much of the recent success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been spurred on by impressive achievements within a broader family of machine learning methods, commonly referred to as Deep Learning (DL). This paper provides insights on the diffusion and impact of DL in science. Through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach on the arXiv.org publication corpus, we delineate the emerging DL technology and identify a list of relevant search terms. These search terms allow us to retrieve DL-related publications from Web of Science across all sciences. Based on that sample, we document the DL diffusion process in the scientific system. We find i) an exponential growth in the adoption of DL as a research tool across all sciences and all over the world, ii) regional differentiation in DL application domains, and iii) a transition from interdisciplinary DL applications to disciplinary research within application domains. In a second step, we investigate how the adoption of DL methods affects scientific development. Therefore, we empirically assess how DL adoption relates to re-combinatorial novelty and scientific impact in the health sciences. We find that DL adoption is negatively correlated with re-combinatorial novelty, but positively correlated with expectation as well as variance of citation performance. Our findings suggest that DL does not (yet?) work as an autopilot to navigate complex knowledge landscapes and overthrow their structure. However, the 'DL principle' qualifies for its versatility as the nucleus of a general scientific method that advances science in a measurable way.},

The estimated mean of our patent value distribution is higher than 3 million euros, the median is about one-tenth of it, and the mode is around a few thousand euros. This is in line with previous findings about the skewed distribution of patent values. Our measure is significantly correlated with the number of patent citations, references, claims, and countries in which the patent is applied. Citations explain value as much as the other three indicators combined, and the right tail of citations is correlated with the right tail of our value measure. Yet, the four indicators only explain 2.7\% of the variance of patent value. Thus, while the use of these indicators as proxies for value, particularly citations, may be justified, predictions based on these indicators carry significant noise. After using country, technology, and patent class fixed effects, we only explain 11.3\% of the variation in patent value. The ‘measure of our ignorance’ about the determinants of patent value is then still sizable, which calls for additional research to fill the gap.},

	abstract = {The following article systematically analyzes the question of how the results of R\&D and its protection - or so to say, the technology base of a firm - can influence its market value and profits. Based on theoretical arguments it is hypothesized that large and highly valuable patent portfolios of firms have significant effects on their competitiveness in the long run. For the empirical testing a panel dataset including 479 firms from 1990 to 2007 based on the DTI-Scoreboard is used, which contains data on R\&D expenditures, market capitalization, turnover etc. and structural information like firm-size and industry sector. To this database the relevant information on patenting behavior and financial performance are added, so effects of firm characteristics can be calculated. To assess the value of a firm's patent portfolio, different value measures like the number of received patent citations, opposed patents, number of inventors etc. are being applied. The results suggest that at least at the firm level, especially forward citations and family size positively influence market value. Concerning the Return on Investment, especially oppositions and family size show positive effects. This leads to the conclusion that securing international markets has a positive effect on the value of the firm in the home market.},

It proposes a wide array of indicators capturing the technological and economic value of patented inventions, and the possible impact that these might have on subsequent technological developments. The measures proposed build extensively upon recent literature, rely on information contained in the patent documents, and are calculated on patent cohorts defined by the combination of the technology field and the year of filing of patents. This is done to account for possible time- and technology-related shocks. The description of the indicators is accompanied by statistics compiled on patents from the European Patent Office, as well as tests aimed at addressing the sensitivity of the measures to alternative specifications and the correlations that may exist among them. The indicators proposed, which can be constructed on all patents, have the advantage of relying on a homogeneous set of information and of being comparable across countries and over time. To facilitate their compilation on data from other Intellectual Property (IP) offices, the SQL-based program codes used to calculate the indicators are also supplied. The paper is further accompanied by a dataset – to be obtained upon request – containing the indicators calculated on EPO patent documents published during the period 1978-2012, as well as some cohort specific statistics (i.e. main moments and key percentiles).},

	url = {https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC118071},
	abstract = {The Techno-Economics Segment (TES) analytical approach aims to offer a timely representation of an integrated and very dynamic technological domain not captured by official statistics or standard classifications. Domains of that type, such as photonics and artificial intelligence (AI), are rapidly evolving and expected to play a key role in the digital transformation, enabling further developments. They are therefore policy relevant and it is important to have available a methodology and tools suitable to map their geographic presence, technological development, economic impact, and overall evolution. The TES approach was developed by the JRC. It provides quantitative analyses in a micro-based perspective.

AI has become an area of strategic importance with potential to be a key driver of economic development. The Commission announced in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its communication "Artificial Intelligence for Europe", COM(2018)237, and in December a Coordinated Action Plan, COM(2018)795. In order to provide quantitative evidences for monitoring AI technologies in the worldwide economies, the TES approach is applied to AI in the present study. The general aim of this work is to provide an analysis of the AI techno-economic complex system, addressing the following three fundamental research questions: (i) Which are the economic players involved in the research and development as well as in the production and commercialisation of AI goods and services? And where are they located? (ii) Which specific technological areas (under the large umbrella of AI) have these players been working at? (iii) How is the network resulting from their collaboration shaped and what collaborations have they been developing?

This report addresses these research questions throughout its different sections, providing both an overview of the AI landscape and a deep understanding of the structure of the socio-economic system, offering useful insights for possible policy initiatives. This is even more relevant and challenging as the considered technologies are consolidating and introducing deep changes in the economy and the society. From this perspective, the goal of this report is to draw a detailed map of the considered ecosystem, and to analyse it in a multidimensional way, while keeping the policy perspective in mind.

The period considered in our analysis covers from 2009 to 2018. We detected close to 58,000 relevant documents and, identified 34,000 players worldwide involved in AI-related economic processes. We collected and processed information regarding these players to set up a basis from which the exploration of the ecosystem can take multiple directions depending on the targeted objective. In this report, we present indicators regarding three dimensions of analysis: (i) the worldwide landscape overview, (ii) the involvement of players in specific AI technological sub-domains, and (iii) the activities and the collaborations in AI R\&D processes. These are just some of the dimensions that can be investigated with the TES approach. We are currently including and analysing additional ones.},

	abstract = {We are only at the beginning of a rapid period of transformation of our economy and society due to the convergence of many digital technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started to appear in our everyday lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the USA, China and Europe. The USA leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing the race but of finding a way to embrace the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that we can only succeed together. We can build on our areas of strength, including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at the regional and sub-regional levels.},

In this paper we critically re-assess these predictions by (i) surveying the recent literature and (ii) incorporating AI-facilitated automation into a product variety-model, frequently used in endogenous growth theory, but modified to allow for demand-side constraints. This is a novel approach, given that endogenous growth models, and including most recent work on AI in economic growth, are largely supply-driven.Our contribution is motivated by two reasons. One is that there are still only very few theoretical models of economic growth that incorporate AI, and moreover an absence of growth models with AI that takes into consideration growth constraints due to insufficient aggregate demand. A second is that the predictions of AI causing massive job losses and faster growth in productivity and GDP are at odds with reality so far: if anything, unemployment in many advanced economies is historically low. However, wage growth and productivity is stagnating and inequality is rising. Our paper provides a theoretical explanation of this in the context of rapid progress in AI.},

Further, firm-level data would also allow for studies of effects on firms of different sizes, the role of market structure in technology adoption, the impact on entrepreneurs and innovators, and the effect on regional economies amongst others. We highlight several ways that such firm-level data could be collected and used by academics, policymakers and other researchers.},

Across a variety of statistics—including robotics shipments, AI start-ups, and patent counts—there is evidence of a large increase in AI-related activity. We also review recent research in this area that suggests that AI and robotics have the potential to increase productivity growth but may have mixed effects on labor, particularly in the short run. In particular, some occupations and industries may do well while others experience labor market upheaval. We then consider current and potential policies around AI that may help to boost productivity growth while also mitigating any labor market downsides, including evaluating the pros and cons of an AI specific regulator, expanded antitrust enforcement, and alternative strategies for dealing with the labor market impacts of AI, including universal basic income and guaranteed employment.},

The analysis is based on official firm-level data on innovation activities and ICT usage in firms for the years 2002–2010, linked to the business registers and the production statistics in ten European countries. The datasets encompass 117,000 firm-year observations. Estimation results reveal that firm productivity is significantly related to product innovations, but to a lesser extent than broadband connected employees. The strength of the association varies across countries and between manufacturing and service firms. As a contrast, process, marketing and organizational innovations are not significantly related to productivity in the majority of countries. Overall, broadband usage appears to be a better predictor of productivity than product innovations.},

We also propose a human evaluation metric called Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), which captures key elements of a human-like multi-turn conversation. Our experiments show strong correlation between perplexity and SSA. The fact that the best perplexity end-to-end trained Meena scores high on SSA (72\% on multi-turn evaluation) suggests that a human-level SSA of 86\% is potentially within reach if we can better optimize perplexity. Additionally, the full version of Meena (with a filtering mechanism and tuned decoding) scores 79\% SSA, 23\% higher in absolute SSA than the existing chatbots we evaluated.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	abstract = {The terms 'human-level artificial intelligence' and 'artificial general intelligence' are widely used to refer to the possibility of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) with potentially extreme impacts on society. These terms are poorly defined and do not necessarily indicate what is most important with respect to future societal impacts. We suggest that the term 'transformative AI' is a helpful alternative, reflecting the possibility that advanced AI systems could have very large impacts on society without reaching human-level cognitive abilities. To be most useful, however, more analysis of what it means for AI to be 'transformative' is needed. In this paper, we propose three different levels on which AI might be said to be transformative, associated with different levels of societal change. We suggest that these distinctions would improve conversations between policy makers and decision makers concerning the mid- to long-term impacts of advances in AI. Further, we feel this would have a positive effect on strategic foresight efforts involving advanced AI, which we expect to illuminate paths to alternative futures. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits of our new framework and by highlighting directions for future work in this area.},

In this paper, we apply a novel methodology of dynamic task shares to a large dataset of online job postings to explore how exactly occupational task demands have changed over the past decade of AI innovation, especially across high, mid and low wage occupations. Notably, big data and AI have risen significantly among high wage occupations since 2012 and 2016, respectively. We built an ARIMA model to predict future occupational task demands and showcase several relevant examples in Healthcare, Administration, and IT. Such task demands predictions across occupations will play a pivotal role in retraining the workforce of the future.},

This paper is the first to estimate the labor demand effects of routine-replacing technological change (RRTC) for Europe as a whole and at the level of 238 European regions. We develop and estimate a task framework of regional labor demand in tradable and non-tradable industries, building on Autor and Dorn (2013) and Goos et al. (2014), and distinguish the main channels through which technological change affects labor demand. These channels include the direct substitution of capital for labor in task production, but also the compensating effects operating through product demand and local demand spillovers. Our results show that RRTC has on net led to positive labor demand effects across 27 European countries over 1999-2010, indicating that labor is racing with the machine. This is not due to limited scope for human-machine substitution, but rather because sizable substitution effects have been overcompensated by product demand and its associated spillovers. However, the size of the product demand spillover – and therefore also RRTC's total labor demand effect – depends critically on where the gains from the increased productivity of technological capital accrue.},
